The three p5 files, as well as the index and sketch file were used to compile a mini project I made for a midterm in a web development class. The p5 files were used to create the pac man shapes and dots, while the sketch was used to create the hitboxes and write in the game mechanics.

The Week 5 assignment was an assignment for a Digital Web class I took, where we would continue to make a website over the course of 3 weeks for the midterm. It used the layout and style files to create tabs and hyperlinks to different points on the page, as well as make video file and image placements. The project was used to make a fan page explaining the story/rules/why we had the interest in a certain show series, game, etc...

The price, stock, and time files were java files I learned during an in class assignment. They are meant as basic formulas to run an internal clock, while also being able to give prices to customers buying products while ensuring that the site would know and keep count over the stock available, so it wouldn't oversell the product.
